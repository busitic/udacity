/*
 * Programming Quiz: Build A Triangle (5-3)
 */

// creates a line of * for a given length
function makeLine(length) {
    var line = "";
    for (var j = 1; j <= length; j++) {
        line += "* ";
    }
    return line + "\n";
    
}

console.log(makeLine(10));

// your code goes here.  Make sure you call makeLine() in your own code.


// test your code by uncommenting the following line
//console.log(buildTriangle(10));

// 1 - need to take number from console.log
// 2 - start at #1 this is how many * I should print out. 
// 3 - then it increases untill it reaches 10. 
// 4 - console.log(makeLine(10)); prints out 10 *. 
// 5 - so I need to create another fuction (buildTriangle) to take the output of makeLine and reduce it by 1
